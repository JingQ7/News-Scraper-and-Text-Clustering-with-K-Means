# py_ScrapingNewsArticles

I'm using Python 3 and Python virtual environments scraping Globalnews.ca to collect data without any framework by following the steps below:
1. Creating a proxy webserver
2. Using urllib opener to get the content of the main page
3. Find a news URL on the main page
4. Scrape all pages data by regular expression
5. Download news and convert into html files separately
